        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A Korean dish using barbecued beef short ribs. <em>Galbit</em> means "ribs" in Korean, and is usually seen in California as <em>LA galbi</em>.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients (serves 4-6)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3.5lb of LA style beef short ribs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of honey</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of sesame oil</li>
            <li>6 cloves of minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 cup of H-Mart beef short rib marinade</li>
            <li>1 bunch of green onions</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Marinade</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Have a big enough bowl ready to mix and marinade the meat.</li>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together into the bowl</li>
            <li>Let the marinade sit in the fridge for at least 20 mins (overnight is best)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare a non-stick pan on low to medium heat (Using non-stick is just easier for clean-up)</li>
            <li><em>"No color, no flavor"</em>. Cook until you see the caramelizing, <em>Mallaird Reaction</em> is a complex process and is the reaction between reducing sugars and proteins by the impact of heat.</li>
            <li>Once you see it browning, take the <em>galbi</em> off the heat and let it rest.</li>
            <li>Chop up some green onions and garnish to finish!</li>
        </ol>
